	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I love solving problems and building things from scratch. The creativity and logic involved in coding excite me, and I enjoy continuously learning new technologies. Being a developer offers great career opportunities, flexibility, and the chance to make a real impact through the tools and applications I create. Itâ€™s a path that combines my passion for technology with the ability to bring ideas to life.</p>
